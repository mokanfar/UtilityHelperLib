# About 
Over the years I have come across many scenarios with data, file system, and web operations that I decided to create a collection of commonly used functions to help with all those mentioned. I used ES6 and class that extend array, + object. Number and strings have prototypes assigned to make object coding more fluid and joy to code with. Type declaration d.ts file included for intellisense

# In a Collection We

Find
Read/analyze
Remove

### Types

Array

### Array/Objects linguistics

{filterout|filter|get|find|remove|combine}
{all|value|index|key} {where|in|with} {value|array|key|index|obj|array}  
{is|isnot|has|doesnothave|isset|isempty} 
{duplicate|unique|different|intersection|same|diff}

### String/Number linguistics

{find|get} {index|key} wherefirstoccurence
countalloccurrencesin {array|obj values}
issetinobj
isin {array|obj}
